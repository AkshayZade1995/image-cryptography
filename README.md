# Image Cryptography

## Abstract
The experimental project shows that the proposed DES algorithm can successfully encrypt/decrypt the images with user input unique secret keys hashing, and the algorithm has good encryption effect over the image which will be will be suitable for the secured transmission over the internet in REAL USE.

## Description & Objective
- The objective of this project is to convert original image into encrypted or non readable format.

- This image can be only readable after the decryption on the same image is done.

- This image can be only readable after the decryption on the same image is done within the software. No other software can decrypt the image by using the same algorithm,.

- Main objective of this to add a security to the image which may contain something important.
